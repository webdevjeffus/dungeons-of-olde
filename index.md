# Welcome to Dungeons of Olde!

You have found the online home of _Dungeons of Olde,_ a project with two purposes.

## Table-top adventure!
First, this is the development home for _Dungeons of Olde,_ a tile-based table-top game that recaptures the excitement and adventure of the original roleplaying games, back in the 1970s, when dungeons were dark, dragons were evil, and nerds weren't cool. With the _Dungeons of Olde_ rules, a few polyhedral dice, a modest handful of print-and-play tiles, counters, and cards, and a couple of hours, a group of friends can become a party of dungeon explorers for an evening. No one needs spend days planning a dungeon, or skip being a hero to referee the game&mdash;_Dungeons of Olde_'s dungeon-generating system creates the adventure for you, on the fly.

### An evening's excursion
The basic concepts and game mechanics driving _Dungeons of Olde_ are simple, and the game is intended to play quickly. The rules as presented here may seem long, but that's because they relate the entire game system&mdash;not just what the numbers in the game are, but how they were generated. You won't need to know all this during play&mdash;everything you need to know to play your character is laid out on his character card. When new elements enter the game, such as monsters, spells, traps, or magic items, they will be presented on their own cards, with complete instructions for how they affect the game. Eventually, a two-page "players' version" of the rules will be added to the site, sufficient to get any player through an evening's adventure.

### You can contribute!
The rules presented here are not yet complete, but they are growing every week. You are encouraged to read them, play them, and offer your input on the development of the game. For now, feedback can sent to the developer, Jeff George, at <a href="mailto:webdevjeffus@gmail.com?Subject=DoO%20comments" target="_top">webdevjeffus@gmail.com</a>; in the future, if there is sufficient interest, I will establish an online forum to discuss the _Dungeons of Olde_ rules and development process.

## Web Dev Exploration
My second purpose in creating the _Dungeons of Olde_ website was to give myself a project to create while learning the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> web development framework. Jekyll is a "simple, blog-aware, static site generator," which means that it allows the web developer to create a set of templates to display site content. With those templates in place, the dev can then add new content, and Jekyll will generate new HTML pages by inserting that new content into the templates. For example, to add a blog post, you simply upload a text file in markdown format, and Jekyll adds a page to the site holding that post, formatted with standard features such as the page header, footer, and navigation bar.

A Jekyll website can be created using an existing Jekyll template&mdash;there are many available, most of them designed for blogging&mdash;or with an entirely original design. Since serving rules for a table-top game is a somewhat unconventional usage of Jekyll, I'm developing custom CSS for the site, specifically developed for the purpose. As a foundation, I used my own <a href="https://github.com/webdevjeffus/drop-in-css" target ="_blank">drop-in.css</a> stylesheet, which provides basic styling for new web apps, and is available for use and contributions as an open-source project hosted on GitHub.
