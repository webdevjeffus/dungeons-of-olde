_Note: This post concludes the brief overview of the origins of **Dungeons of Olde** which began in my first post to this blog. If you haven't read it yet, click the link above to **Part 1** to read the story from its beginning._

## Computers bring me back to games...again...
After my decade as a photographer, I spent most of the next decade&mdash;from 2007 to 2014&mdash;as a public school teacher in the Bronx, NY. While teaching, I began a Masters in Instructional Design and Technology, which led me to become interested in software development once again (I'd only taken a 25-year break&hellip;). I began studying software development through various means, and in the fall of 2015, I began the web development immersive program at <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a> (DBC) in New York City. It was during my time at DBC that I found myself playing table-top games for the first time since the early 1990s.

Any time you get enough software people together in one place, you're going to have gathered enough table-top gamers to play a game. We didn't have a lot of time to play games during the program, but I did manage to play _Carcasonne_, which I'd owned for years but never played, and _Settlers of Cataan_, which I'd seen in Barnes and Noble and on _Big Bang Theory_ but again, had never played. I also got to play cooperative games that were totally new to me, including _Pandemic_ and _Betrayal at House on the Hill_. And in the DBC cohort just behind my own, a low-key _D&D_ campaign emerged. Although I wasn't able to participate in that campaign, I did get to watch a few of their lunchtime sessions. Suddenly, I was jonesing for a table-top RPG session like I hadn't for years.

## The _Dungeons of Olde_ project arises
By the spring of 2016, I had graduated from DBC and was building my web dev portfolio while looking for a job. I was looking for a project that would let me learn the Jekyll static website generator and the associated Liquid templating language _before_ I re-engineered my portfolio website, which was written in simple HTML5/CSS3.

About this same time, while Googling random table-top RPG keywords late one night, I happened across across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/theDMsCraft" target="_blank">theDMsCraft</a>, DM Scotty's table-top gaming channel on YouTube. Scotty's videos are mostly crafting how-tos, showing you how to make really nice table-top miniatures for next to no money&mdash;assuming you have a fair amount of time to invest. I watched several of Scotty's videos, then bookmarked the playlist, hoping some day to have the time to try out some of his techniques.

Then I found the downloadable gaming resources at <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse.php?filters=0_2200_0_0_0" target="_blank">DriveThruRPG.com</a>. I was particularly taken by the printable paper miniatures&mdash;the distant descendants of the <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/heroes/" target="_blank">_Cardboard Heroes_</a> paper minis we published while I was at Steve Jackson Games. I downloaded, printed, and constructed a few of the free sets, just for kicks. Then I bought a few of the paid sets, and printed those as well.

Pretty soon, I had about 50 inch-tall paper warriors marching across my desk, with nothing to do with them. My daughter, a third grader, enjoyed playing with them on the coffee table, though, and I began to wish I knew of a table-top fantasy rule set simple enough for a nine-year-old to play, but complex enough to hold an adult's interest.

<em>Hey, wait a minute&hellip;</em>

Then I remembered that old rule set I'd started all those years ago. If that set of rules were finished, and if they were as simple and straightforward as I originally intended them to be, they might be the perfect game for me to play with my daughter and all these paper miniatures. Of course, I couldn't justify spending hours and hours working on a table-top game when I had a web dev portfolio to build.

<em>Hey, wait a minute&hellip;</em>

In a flash of inspiration, I hit upon the idea of using the development of that rule set as the content for a large, static website built with Jekyll and Liquid. _Genius!_ I could finish the game I'd abandoned several times over the past three decades, _and_ develop a marketable web dev skill, all at once! What could possibly go wrong?
