<em>Dungeons of Olde</em> is something that's been rolling around in the bottom of my brain for decades, floating up near the surface for a few days or weeks once every few years. It has more ancestors and influences than even I can name. In this first blog post on the <em>DO</em> development website, I'll try to trace the evolution of the idea that is now, finally becoming a playable table-top game.

## Somewhere in Austin, late in the last century...
In a sense, the development of <em>Dungeons of Olde</em> started over 25 years ago. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, I was working as a game developer and writer at Origin Systems, the publisher of the <em>Ultima</em> and <em>Wing Commander</em> series of PC games. I had previously worked in the table-top gaming industry, as a staff editor for Steve Jackson Games, and later as a freelancer for various companies. Not surprisingly, there were a lot of table-top gamers working at Origin. We played board games at lunchtime fairly often, and from time to time, an RPG campaign would start up, run a couple of sessions, and then fade in the face of another deadline crunch.

Many of us were looking for something that would give us the unique adventure of a fantasy RPG, without the overhead of creating and running an ongoing campaign. We played and enjoyed Milton Bradley's <em>Hero Quest</em>, but we were looking for something a little bit richer. There was a sweet spot somewhere between <em>Hero Quest</em> and "real" RPGs like <em>AD&D</em> and Steve Jackson's <em>GURPS</em>, but there wasn't a game system to fill it. The nearest fit was SJG's <em>Toon</em>&mdash;it had about the right balance of rules complexity vs. flexibility, and didn't require a 20-hour-a-week time commitment from the GM. But the fast-and-loose, Looney-Tunes tone was baked into <em>Toon</em>, and adapting the system for play in another genre wouldn't have been much different than designing a new game from the ground up.

So that's what I decided to do. I began noodling around with dice, trying to come up with a fantasy RPG that was deeper than Hero Quest, but faster-playing than <em>D&D</em> and its peers. I eventually had a draft of a basic rules system that used four characteristics to quantify character abilities on a scale of 1 to 12. I settled on that scale, rather than the more common 3-18 (or 1-20, depending on how you look at it) scale of most RPGs at the time because I wanted to make polyhedral dice a central and meaningful part of the game. That first draft already included <em>DO</em>'s central game mechanic, that a character's stats determine which polyhedral dice he'll throw when doing things.

But another deadline crunch arose at Origin&mdash;no idea which one&mdash;and that rules draft got buried in my desk. Out of site, out of mind. By 1992, I had left the game development profession&mdash;table-top and PC&mdash;and moved on to other careers. In fact, I didn't play a game or touch a computer until almost ten years later&hellip;

## Computers bring me back to games...eventually...
I spent about a decade, from the mid-1990s until the mid-2000s, as a commercial photographer. I started as a photo assistant in Pheonix, Arizona, but eventually moved to New York City and opened my own studio. This put me in the photo business during the transition from film to digital photography. During the course of this transition, as I began using computers for several hours a day at work, I sifted through my old floppy disks, and tripped over that old first draft of my RPG rule system.

At first, I didn't think much of the discovery, but one night I opened the file and read through it. I remembered what I what I was trying to do with that system, and how I was trying to do it. Although I didn't have a gaming group at the time, I edited and developed the rules a bit further anyway. About the same time, I started playing computer games again, including <em>Diablo, Baldur's Gate, Dungeon Siege, Warcraft,</em> and several more. Working on a table-top rules set, while playing single-player computer games, made me really nostalgic for gaming. But there was no good way for someone out of school to find fellow gamers&mdash;social media hadn't really happened yet.

And then...<em>Everquest</em>!

It wasn't a perfect simulation of table-top roleplaying, but MMOs did bring a social aspect to computer gaming, and for a while (a <em>long</em> while, as it turned out&hellip;), that was good enough. Table-top gaming, and the rules set I was fiddling with, were once again forgotten, and I spent my free time chasing around Norrath, Camelot, Paragon City, Tatooine, and Azeroth for the better part of a decade.

## Computers bring me back to games...again...
After my decade of photography, I spent most of a decade&mdash;from 2007 to 2014&mdash;as a public school teacher in the Bronx, NY. While teaching, I began a Masters in Instructional Design and Technology, over the course of which I became interested in software development once again (I'd only taken a 25-year break&hellip;). I began studying software development through various means, and in the fall of 2015, I began the web development immersive program at Dev Bootcamp (DBC). It was during my time at DBC that I found myself playing table-top games for the first time since the early 1990s.

Any time you get enough software people together in one place, you're going to have gathered enough table-top gamers to play a game. We didn't have a lot of time to play games during the program, but I did manage to play <em>Carcasonne</em>, which I'd owned for years but never played, and <em>Settlers of Cataan</em>, which I'd in Barnes and Noble and on <em>Big Bang theory</em> but again, never played. I also got to play cooperative games that were totally new to me, including <em>Pandemic</em> and <em>Betrayal at House on the Hill</em>. And in the DBC cohort just behind my own, a low-key <em>D&D</em> campaign arose; although I wasn't able to participate, I did get to watch a few of their lunchtime sessions. Suddenly, I was jonesing for a table-top RPG session like I hadn't for years.

## The _Dungeons of Olde_ project arises
By the spring of 2016, I had graduated from DBC and was building my web dev portfolio while looking for a job. I was looking for a project that would let me learn the Jekyll web development framework and the Liquid templating language <em>before</em> I re-engineered my portfolio website, which was written in simple HTML5/CSS3.

About this same time, while Googling random table-top RPG keywords late one night, I happened across across DM Scotty's 2.5D gaming videos on YouTube. Scotty's videos are mostly crafting how-tos, showing you how to make really nice table-top miniatures for next to no money&mdash;assuming you have a fair amount of time to invest. I watched several of Scotty's videos, then bookmarked the playlist, hoping some day to have the time to try out some of his techniques.

Then I found the downloadable resources at DriveThruRPG.com. I was particularly taken by the printable paper miniatures&mdash;the distant descendants of the <em>Cardboard Heroes</em> paper minis we published while I was at Steve Jackson Games. I downloaded, printed, and constructed a few of the free sets, just for kicks. Then I bought a few of the paid sets, and printed those as well.

Pretty soon, I had about 50 inch-tall paper warriors marching across my desk, with nothing to do with them. My daughter, a third grader, enjoyed playing with them on the coffee table, though, and I began to wish I knew of a table-top fantasy rule set simple enough for a nine-year-old to play, but complex enough to hold an adult's interest.

Hey, wait a minute&hellip;

Then I remembered that old rule set I'd written all those years ago. If that set of rules were finished, and if they were as simple and straightforward as I originally intended them to be, they might be the perfect game for me to play with my daughter and all these paper miniatures. Of course, I couldn't justify spending hours and hours working on a table-top game when I had a web dev portfolio to build.

Hey, wait a minute&hellip;

In a flash of inspiration, I hit upon the idea of using the development of that rule set as the content for a large, static website built with Jekyll and Liquid. _Genius!_ I could finish the game I'd abandoned several times over the past three decades, _and_ develop a marketable web dev skill, all at once! What could possibly go wrong?
