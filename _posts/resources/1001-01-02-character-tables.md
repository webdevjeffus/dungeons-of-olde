<p>This page presents all the tables relevant to creating and upgrading characters, including Stats, Skills, and Equipment.</p>

<h2>Primary and <span class="no-break">Secondary Stats</span></h2>

<p>Every hero is defined by four Primary Stats and one or more Secondary Stats. All characters have Hit Points, but only characters who cast spells have Mana Points or Faith Points.</p>

{% include tables/stats-definitions-table.html %}

<h2>Creating Characters</h2>
<p>Under the Core Rules, characters are created by choosing one Stat Array and one Skill Package. Under the Crunchy Characters optional rules, characters are created by spending 20 character points (CP) on any combination of Stats and Skills; CP costs are listed in the tables.
