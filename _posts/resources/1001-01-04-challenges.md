<p>This page presents summarized rules and tables for resolving challenges in <em>Dungeons of Olde</em>.</p>

<h5>Check Rolls</h5>
<p>To attempt a challenge, a character makes a Check roll, throwing two exploding Stat Dice for the Stat or Skill used in the challenge, then adding or subtracting any adjustments. The result is compared to a the challenge rating (CR) for the challenge. If the result equals or exceeds the challenge rating, the attempt is successful; if the result is less than the challenge rating, the attempt fails.</p>

{% include tables/challenges-table.html %}

<h5>Making an Attempt</h5>
<ol>
  <li>GM determines the difficulty of the challenge (Challenge Rating, or CR) and the Stat or Skill necessary to attempt it.</li>
  <li>The character attempting the challenge makes a Check roll using that Stat or Skill.</li>
  <li>If the Check roll succeeds or fails by 3 or more points, he may experience an exceptional result&mdash;see Critical Outcomes.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Critical Outcomes</h5>
<p>If a hero succeeds or fails a Check by a wide margin, he may experience a critical outcome. Critical outcomes are measured in ranks of success or failure, each rank requiring an additional margin of 3 points above or below the challenge rating for the attempt. The gamemaster will determine the exact nature of a exceptional success or failure.</p>

<p>Critical outcomes in combat have specific affects; see the Combat Critical Outcomes table.</p>

<h5>Opposed Attempts</h5>
<p>A challenge that acts directly against another character is an opposed attempt.</p>
<ol>
  <li>GM determines the Skill or Stat the target of the attempt will use to resist the attempt.</li>
  <li>Target rolls two exploding Stat dice for the Stat or Skill used oppose the challenge, resolving any exploding dice, then adding or subtracting any adjustments to the total.</li>
  <li>The instigator of the attempt makes a Check roll, using the result of the target's roll as the challenge rating.</li>
  <li>If the instigator's roll equals or exceeds the target's roll, the opposed attempt is successful; if not, the opposed attempt fails.</li>
  <li>Exceptional outomes may apply opposed attempts, at the gamemaster's discretion.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Assisted Attempts</h5>
<p>A character may try to assist an ally attempting a challenge.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The assistant makes Check roll, using the instigator's Stat or Skill as the challenge rating.</li>
  <li>For every rank of success in the attempt to assist, the instigator may add one to the Check roll in his own attempt.</li>
  <li>If the assistant fails his Check roll by two or more ranks, the instigator takes a penalty on his Check roll equal to the number of failure ranks the assistant rolled, minus 1.</li>
  <li>Assistants earn experience for exceptional outcomes on attempts to assist.</li>
</ol>
