<p>This page summarizes the key mechanics that form the foundation of the <em>Dungeons of Olde</em> rule system. It is presented as a concise set of notes, without explanation or example, for quick reference. Fuller explanations of the Core Rules mechanics are presented on the pages that follow.</p>

<h2>Stats</h2>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Primary Stats</th>
    <th>Secondary Stats</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Brawn:</strong> Physical might</li>
        <li><strong>Finesse:</strong> Agility and quickness</li>
        <li><strong>Savvy:</strong> Mental sharpness</li>
        <li><strong>Nerve:</strong> Strength of will</li>

        <li><strong>Hit Points</strong> = Brawn + ( Nerve/2 )</li>
        <li><strong>Mana Points</strong> = Savvy + ( Nerve/2 )</li>
        <li><strong>Faith Points</strong> = Nerve + ( Savvy/2 )</li>
      </ul>

<p>Starting characters may choose from the following Stat Sets. The values in each set may be assigned to the Primary Stats in any order. Secondary Stats are then derived from the assigned Primary Stat values.</p>

<h2>Dice</h2>
<h5>Dice declarations</h5>
<p>Die rolls are described in the following format: <strong><em>N</em>d<em>S</em></strong>, where <strong><em>N</em></strong> is the number of dice thrown, and <strong><em>S</em></strong> is the number of sides on the die. Exploding dice are indicated with an <strong>!</strong> at the end. Thus, a declaration of <strong>2d6</strong> means two six-sided dice, while <strong>2d8!</strong> indicates two <em>exploding</em> eight-sided dice.</p>

<h5>Die Ranks</h5>
<p>Dice have a <strong>Die Rank</strong> (DR) equal to their number of sides. Thus, d6's have DR 6.</p>

<h5>Stat Dice</h5>
<p>Each of a character's Primary Stats has an associated die, with a Die Rank equal to the value of that Stat. Thus, if a hero has Savvy 6, his Savvy die is a d6.</p>

<h6 class="ftrm-none">Modifying Stat Dice</h6>
<p>Some persistent conditions can <strong>Modify</strong> the Die Rank of a given Stat Die. Modifications do not affect the value of the Stat itself, but effect all die rolls based on that Stat as long as the condition persists. Stat Die Modifications are applied before the dice are rolled, to each die thrown. For example, a hero with Brawn 8 contracts an illness that applies a Die Rank modifier of negative two to Brawn; until that illness is cured, he will have to roll his Modified Brawn dice, d6's, instead of his normal Brawn dice, which are d8's.</p>

<h5>Exploding Dice</h5>
<p>Many rolls in <em>Dungeons of Olde</em> are made with <em>exploding dice</em>. When rolling an exploding die, if the maximum value for a die is rolled, its value is counted in the total for the roll, then the die is thrown again, and <em>that</em> value is also added to the total. The process is repeated until the die shows a result other than the maximum value.</p>
<p>For example, an exploding d8 is thrown and shows an 8, the maximum possible value. That 8 is counted as part of the total for the roll, and the die is thrown again, this time showing a 4. Since 4 is <em>not</em> the maximum value on a d8, the roll is now finished. The 4 on the second throw is added to the previous total of 8, for a final total of 12.</p>

<h5>Odd Dice</h5>
<p>When rolling a die with an odd-numbered Die Rank (5, 7, 9, etc.), roll the next larger die, and count the maximum result as if it were the median (middle) result. For example, for a d7, roll a d8, and count any roll of "8" as if it were the median value of 4.</p>
<p>An odd die explodes when the named value of the die is thrown. That is, a d5 explodes when a "5" is thrown. Thus, when d5! is thrown, results of "1," "2," "3," and "4" are counted at their face value; a "6" is counted as a 3; and a "5" explodes, contributing 5 to the total and rolling again.</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>Any task where there is a chance of meaningful failure is resolved as a <strong>Challenge</strong>. The difficulty of the Challenge is expressed as a number, called the <strong>Challenge Rating</strong>.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Difficulty</th>
    <th>Challenge Rating</th>
    <th></th>
    <th>Difficulty</th>
    <th>Challenge Rating</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Trivial</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Heroic</td>
    <td>15</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Easy</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Superhuman</td>
    <td>18</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Hard</td>
    <td>12</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Godly</td>
    <td>21</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>When a hero tries to overcome a Challenge, he makes an <strong>Attempt</strong>. An Attempt always includes a <strong>Check Roll</strong>, which determines <em>if</em> he succeeds at the task, and may include an <strong>Effect Roll</strong>, which determines the <em>degree</em> of that success.</p>
<p>Every Attempt is made using Stat Dice for the Primary Stat relevant to the nature of the Challenge. For example, a Challenge calling for brute force uses a hero's Brawn dice, while a Challenge requiring courage uses his Nerve dice.</p>

<h5>Check Rolls</h5>
<p>Success in an Attempt requires a Check Roll, in which the hero must roll equal to or above the Challenge Rating on two exploding Stat Dice. A character with Brawn 8 Attempting to lift a heavy portcullis (Challenge Rating 12) would need to roll a 12 or better on 2d8!.</p>

<h6 class="ftrm-none">Adjusting Check Rolls</h6>
<p>Certain skills, items or other circumstances may adjust the result of a Check Roll. Adjustments may add to or subtract from the result of the Check roll, and are applied once only, after all exploding dice have been resolved.</p>

<h6 class="ftrm-none">Opposed Attempts</h6>
<p>A Challenge that pits one character directly against another requires an <strong>Opposed Attempt</strong>. The character making the Opposed Attempt is called the <strong>Instigator</strong>, while the character resisting the Attempt is the <strong>Target</strong>.</p>
<p>In an Opposed Attempt, each character rolls two exploding Stat Dice. The target rolls first, and his result becomes the CR for the Instigator's Check Roll. Then the instigator rolls. If the instigator's roll equals or exceeds the target's roll, the Opposed Attempt succeeds.</p>

<h6 class="ftrm-none">Assisted Attempts</h6>
<p>Certain Challenges may allow for an ally to <strong>Assist</strong> a hero attempting a Challenge (Instigator). The Assistant makes a Check Roll with a Challenge Rating equal to the Relevant Stat of the Instigator. If the Assistant's Check Roll equals the Instigator's Relevant Stat, the Instigator gets +1 on his Attempt. This bonus is increased by +1 for every <em>two</em> points by which the Assistant's Check Roll exceeds the Instigator's Relevant Stat.</p>

<h5>Effect Rolls</h5>
<p>In some cases, a successful Check Roll is followed by an Effect Roll, to determine <em>how effective</em> the success was. Effect Rolls also use the die for the Relevant Stat. Depending on the circumstances, an Effect Roll may call for one, two, or more dice. Effect rolls are made with exploding dice, unless the rules specify otherwise.</p>
