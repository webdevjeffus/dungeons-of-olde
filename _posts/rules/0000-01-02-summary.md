<p>This page summarizes the key mechanics that form the foundation of the <em>Dungeons of Olde</em> rule system. It is presented as a concise set of notes, without explanation or example, for quick reference. Fuller explanations of the Core Rules mechanics are presented on the pages that follow.</p>

<h2 id="characters">Characters</h2>
<p>Player characters in <em>Dungeons of Olde</em> are often referred to as "heroes." Each hero has several Stats and Skills which determine his dungeon-delving abilities. Heroes created under the <em>Dungeons of Olde</em> Core Rules choose one <a href="#stat-arrays">Stat Array</a> and one <a href="#skill-packages">Skill Package</a>; heroes created under the <strong>Crunchy Characters</strong> rules option are built using a point-based system that allows players to customize their Stats and Skills. The Stat Arrays and Skill Packages in the Core Rules follow the Crunchy Characters point system, so there is no risk of imbalance if your party contains a mix of Core and Crunchy characters.</p>

<h5 id="stats">Stats</h5>

<p>Starting heroes created under the <em>Dungeons of Olde</em> Core Rules choose from the following Stat Arrays. The values in each set may be assigned to the Primary Stats in any order. Secondary Stats are then derived from the assigned Primary Stat values.</p>

<h6 id="stat-dice">Stat Dice</h6>
<p>Each of a character's Primary Stats has an associated die, with a number of sides, or <a href="#die-rank">Die Rank</a>, equal to the value of that Stat. Thus, if a hero has Savvy 6, his Savvy die is a d6. Secondary Stats are only used to track a hero's state of health and energy, and therefore have no associated dice.</p>

<h5 id="skill-packages">Skills</h5>
<p>Each hero created under the <em>Dungeons of Olde</em> Core Rules chooses one Skill Package from the following table. More information on <a href="#skills">Skills</a>, including the contents of the various Skill Sets, is included in the Skills section of the Core Rules.</p>

{% include tables/skill-packages-table.html %}

<h2>Dice</h2>

<h5 id="die-rank">Die Ranks</h5>
<p>Dice in have a <strong>Die Rank</strong> (DR) equal to their number of sides. Thus, d6's have DR 6.</p>

<h5 id="dice-declaration">Dice declarations</h5>
<p>Die rolls are described in the following format: <strong><em>N</em>d<em>R</em></strong>, where <strong><em>N</em></strong> is the number of dice thrown, and <strong><em>R</em></strong> is the Die Rank, or number of sides on the die. <a href="#exploding-dice">Exploding dice</a> are indicated with an <strong>!</strong> at the end. Thus, a declaration of <strong>2d6</strong> means two six-sided dice, while <strong>2d8!</strong> indicates two <em>exploding</em> eight-sided dice.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an <span id="adjustments"><strong>Adjustment</strong></span> will be made to a die roll. In such cases, the number to be added to or subtracted from the roll will be included in the die declaration immediately following the number of sides. As such, <strong>2d4+1</strong> directs you to roll two 4-sided dice, and add 1 to the total, while <strong>1d12!-1</strong> declares that you roll one exploding 12-sided die, and subtract 1 from the result.</p>

<h5 id="roll-throw">Rolling the Dice vs. Throwing the Dice</h5>
<p>In these rules, a "throw" of the dice is the single, specific act of shaking a die (or dice) and dropping it (them) onto the table to randomly generate a single value. A die "roll," on the other hand, refers to the potentially multi-step process of using dice produce a final value, including any modifications, additions from any exploding dice, and adjustments. Thus, a single die <em>roll</em> may include one or more die <em>throws</em>, along with a little bit of algebra to factor in modifications and adjustments.</p>
<p>For example, a die <em>roll</em> calling for 2d4!+1 (two four-sided dice, exploding, plus one point) begins with a <em>throw</em> of two d4's, which turn up a 2 and a 4, for a subtotal of 6. Since these are exploding dice, however, the die showing the 4 is picked up and <em>thrown</em> again, this time showing another 4, and exploding again. The value of 4 is added to the running total, bringing it to 10, and that die is <em>thrown</em> again, this time turning up a 1, which brings the running total to 11. Since we're through <em>throwing</em> dice, we find the final result of the <em>roll</em> by adding in the adjustment of +1, for a final total of 12.</p>
<p>The distinction between die rolls and die throws is generally clear from context throughout the rules, so don't worry too much about it. But we did want to be clear that <em>Dungeons of Olde</em> does deliberately use these words to mean slightly different things.</p>

<h5 id="exploding-dice">Exploding Dice</h5>
<p>Many rolls in <em>Dungeons of Olde</em> are made with <em>exploding dice</em>. When throwing an exploding die, if the maximum value for a die is shown, its value is counted in the total for the roll, then the die is thrown again, and <em>that</em> value is also added to the total. The process is repeated until the die shows a result other than the maximum value.</p>
<p>For example, an exploding d8 is thrown and shows an 8, the maximum possible value. That 8 is counted as part of the total for the roll, and the die is thrown again, this time showing a 4. Since 4 is <em>not</em> the maximum value on a d8, the roll is now finished. The 4 on the second throw is added to the previous total of 8, for a final total of 12.</p>

<h5 id="odd-dice">Odd Dice</h5>
<p>When rolling a die with an odd-numbered <a href="#die-rank">Die Rank</a> (5, 7, 9, etc.), roll the next larger die, and count the maximum result as if it were the median (middle) result. For example, for a d7, roll a d8, and count any roll of "8" as if it were the median value of 4.</p>
<p>An odd die explodes when the named value of the die is thrown. That is, a d5 explodes when a "5" is thrown. Thus, when d5! is thrown, results of "1," "2," "3," and "4" are counted at their face value; a "6" is counted as a 3; and a "5" explodes, contributing 5 to the total and rolling again.</p>

<h5 id="adv-disadv">Advantage and Disadvantage</h5>
<p>Some die rolls are made with <strong>Advantage</strong> or <strong>Disadvantage</strong>. When rolling with Advantage, throw two dice and use the <em>more</em> favorable result. For Disadvantage, throw two dice and use the <em>less</em> favorable result. For rolls involving multiple dice, throw two full sets of dice, total each set separately, and use the more or less favorable result, as appropriate.</p>

<h5 id="modifying-dice">Modifying Stat Dice</h5>
<p>Some persistent conditions can <strong>Modify</strong> the <a href="#die-rank">Die Rank</a> of a given <a href="#stat-dice">Stat Die</a>. Modifications do not affect the value of the Stat itself, but affect all die rolls based on that Stat as long as the condition persists. Stat Die Modifications are applied before the dice are rolled, to each die thrown. For example, a hero with Brawn 8 contracts an illness that applies a Die Rank modifier of -2 to Brawn; until that illness is cured, he will have to roll his Modified Brawn dice, d6's, instead of his normal Brawn dice, which are d8's.</p>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<p>Any task where there is a chance of meaningful failure is resolved as a <strong>Challenge</strong>. The difficulty of the Challenge is expressed by its descriptive Rank, and a number, called the <span id="challenge-rating"><strong>Challenge Rating</strong></span>, or <strong>CR</strong>.</p>

{% include tables/challenges-table.html %}

<p>When a hero tries to overcome a Challenge, he makes an <span id="attempt"><strong>Attempt</strong></span>. An Attempt always includes a <strong><a href="check-roll">Check Roll</a></strong>, which determines <em>if</em> he succeeds at the task, and may include an <strong><a href="effect-roll">Effect Roll</a></strong>, which determines the <em>degree</em> of that success.</p>
<p>Every Attempt is made using <a href="#stat-dice">Stat Dice</a> for the <a href="#stats">Primary Stat</a> relevant to the nature of the Challenge. For most tasks, there will be an applicable <a href="#skills">Skill</a>, so the Attempt will use the Check Stat for that Skill. For example, a Challenge calling for brute force uses a hero's Brawn dice, while a Challenge requiring courage uses his Nerve dice.</p>

<h5 id="check-rolls">Check Rolls</h5>
<p>Success in an Attempt requires a Check Roll, in which the hero must roll equal to or above the <a href="#challenges">Challenge Rating</a> on two <a href="#exploding-dice">exploding</a> <a href="#stat-dice">Stat Dice</a>. A character with Brawn 8 Attempting to lift a heavy portcullis (Challenge Rating 12) would need to roll a 12 or better on 2d8!.</p>

<h6>Adjusting Check Rolls</h6>
<p>Certain skills, items or other circumstances may adjust the result of a Check Roll. <a href="#adjustments">Adjustments</a> may add to or subtract from the result of the Check roll, and are applied once only, after all exploding dice have been resolved.</p>
<p>Note that <a href="#modifying-dice">Modifications</a> change the <a href="#die-rank">Die Rank</a> of the dice to be rolled, and are applied <em>before</em> the dice are thrown. Adjustments, on the other hand, change the <em>result</em> of the roll, and are applied <em>after</em> the dice are thrown and totalled.</p>

<h6 id="opposed-attempts">Opposed Attempts</h6>
<p>A <a href="#challenges">Challenge</a> that pits one character directly against another requires an <strong>Opposed Attempt</strong>. The character making the Opposed Attempt is called the <span id="instigator"><strong>Instigator</strong></span>, while the character resisting the Attempt is the <span id="target"><strong>Target</strong></span>.</p>
<p>In an Opposed Attempt, each character rolls two <a href="#exploding-dice">exploding</a> <a href="#stat-dice">Stat Dice</a>. The target rolls first, and his result becomes the <a href="#challenge-rating">Challenge Rating</a> for the Instigator's Check Roll. Then the instigator rolls. If the instigator's roll equals or exceeds the target's roll, the Opposed Attempt succeeds.</p>

<h6 id="assisted-attempts">Assisted Attempts</h6>
<p>Certain <a href="#challenges">Challenges</a> may allow for an ally to <strong>Assist</strong> a hero attempting a Challenge (Instigator). The Assistant makes a <a href="#check-rolls">Check Roll</a> with a Challenge Rating equal to the Instigator's <a href="#skills">Check Stat</a> for the Skill he's using in his Attempt. If the Assistant's Check Roll equals the Instigator's Check Stat, the Instigator gets +1 on his Attempt. This bonus is increased by +1 for every <em>two</em> points by which the Assistant's Check Roll exceeds the Instigator's Check Stat.</p>

<h6 id="scaling-challenges">Checks Against Scaling Challenges</h6>
<p>A <strong>Scaling Challenge</strong> occurs in circumstances where the character's doing especially well at the <a href="#challenges">Challenge</a> may result in a quantifiably greater effect. A Scaling Check has a Challenge Rank and Rating, but for every Challenge Rank by which the character succeeds, he achieves additional success. For example, if a hero had just a few seconds to gather usable arrows after a battle, the GM might decide to handle the attempt as an Easy Scalable Challenge (CR 6) to the Alertness skill, with each Rank of success turning up three intact arrows. The player rolls his Alertness Check using its <a href="#skills">Check Stat</a>, Savvy, scoring an 11, and recovers six arrows in all&mdash;three for the succeeding at the Easy level, and three more for also having met the Moderate Challenge Rating of 9.</p>

<h5 id="effect-rolls">Effect Rolls</h5>
<p>In some cases, a successful <a href="#check-rolls">Check Roll</a> is followed by an Effect Roll, to determine <em>how effective</em> the success was. Effect Rolls also use the character's Stat Die for the applicable <a href="#skills">Skill's Check Stat</a>. Depending on the circumstances, an Effect Roll may call for one, two, or more dice. Effect rolls are made with <a href="#exploding-dice">exploding dice</a>, unless the rules specify otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="actions-movement">Actions and Movement</h2>
<p>Outside of combat, time and distance are controlled and narrated by the GM, following common sense and guidelines in the GM's section of these rules.</p>
<p>In combat, the game is played with miniatures on a square or hex grid. The <span id="scale"><strong>Map Scale</strong></span> is either 5 feet per space, or 2 meters per space, whichever your group prefers. Time is measured in <strong>Turns, Phases</strong> and <strong>Rounds</strong>, which are brief but somewhat flexible units.</p>

<h5 id="turns">Turns and Phases</h5>
<p>Each Turn is made up of an <strong>Action Phase</strong> and a <strong>Reset Phase</strong>. All movement and other actions are made during the Action Phase, which is broken up into a variable number of rounds. The Reset Phase is an accounting step, in which temporary conditions are resolved and persistent conditions are updated.</p>

<h6 id="reset-phase">Reset Phase</h6>
<p>Combat always begins and ends with a Reset Phase. During the Reset Phase, the following steps are taken, in order:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Apply any <strong><span id="per-turn">per Turn</span></strong> effects, such as poison or bleeding</li>
  <li>Remove any <strong><span id="temporary">Temporary</span></strong> Conditions and Adjustments (which end at the conclusion of the Turn in which they were inflicted)</li>
  <li>Roll to remove any <strong><span id="persistent">Persistent</span></strong> Conditions (which end only if the character succeeds on the necessary <a href="#check-rolls">Check Roll</a>)</li>
  <li><strong><span id="recover">Recover</span></strong> 1 Mana Point <em>or</em> 1 Faith Point, player's choice</li>
  <li>
    Set Action Points (AP) and Free Steps for the coming Action Phase
    <ul class="bulleted circle">
      <li>Left-over Action Points and/or Free Steps from the preceeding Action Phase are lost</li>
      <li>Roll one <a href="#stat-dice">Finesse Die</a> for <a href="#action-points">Action Points</a>, and apply any adjustments</li>
      <li>Surprised characters receive <em>exactly</em> 1 Action Point in the first Reset Phase of a combat; afterwards, they roll for AP normally</li>
      <li>All characters receive a single <a href="#free-steps">Free Steps move</a> each turn</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The current <a href="turns">Turn</a> ends, and play proceeds to the <a href="#action-phase">Action Phase</a> of the next Turn.</li>
</ol>

<h6 id="action-phase">Action Phase</h6>
<p>The Action Phase is divided into a series of <strong><span id="rounds">Rounds</span></strong>, in which each character has one opportunity to act by expending <a href="#action-points">Action Points</a>, according to the following rules:
<ul class="bulleted ftrm">
  <li>In each Round, characters act in descending order of <em>current</em> Action Points.</li>
  <li>Once per <a href="#turns">Turn</a>, a character may take <strong><span id="free-steps">Free Steps</span></strong> <em>before</em> performing any other <a href="#movements-table">Movement</a> or <a href="#actions-table">Action</a>.
    <ul class="bulleted circle">
      <li>The Free Step distance for medium-sized characters (humans, elves, orcs) is one or two spaces, which must be taken at once.</li>
      <li>The Free Step for small-sized characters (halflings, dwarves, goblins) is one space.</li>
      <li>Free Steps do not cost Action Points to use.</li>
      <li>A character doesn't have to <em>spend</em> Action Points in the Round he uses his Free Steps, but a character must <em>have</em> AP remaining in order to use his Free Steps.</li>
      <li>A character may take his Free Steps immediately before an <a href="#only-action">Only action</a>.</li>
      <li>Free Steps remaining at the end of the Turn are lost.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In a single <a href="#rounds">Round</a>, a character may spend a total of no more than 3 <strong><span id="action-points">Action Points</span></strong> to perform one <a href="#movements-table">Movement</a> and/or one <a href="#actions-table">Action.</a>
    <ul class="bulleted circle">
      <li>Action Points are marked off the character sheet as they are spent.</li>
      <li>If a character has only 1 or 2 Action Points to spend in a Turn, he may spend <em>all</em> of his AP for the Turn to take an <strong><span id="only-action">Only</span></strong> action.</li>
      <li>When a character has expended all his Action Points, he may take no more actions until the next <a href="turns">Turn</a>.</li>
      <li>Certain <a href="#movements-table">Movements</a> and <a href="actions-table">Actions</a> may apply <a href="#temporary">Temporary Adjustments</a> to a character's attributes, especially <a href="defense-check">Defense</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A character may pass his opportunity to act in the current Round, saving his Action Points until a subsequent Round</li>
  <li>The <a href="#action-phase">Action Phase</a> ends when every character in the combat has either:
    <ul class="bulleted circle">
      <li>Expended all his Action Points, and has 0 AP remaining, or</li>
      <li>Has passed on his opportunity to act in the current Round</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>After the conclusion of the Action Phase, play proceeds to the <a href="#reset-phase">Reset Phase</a> for the current <a href="#turns">Turn</a>.</li>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>These rules first lay down the basics of melee combat, then present additional rules for <a href="#unarmed-combat">Brawling</a> (close combat, generally without weapons) and <a href="#ranged-combat">Ranged Attacks</a>.</p>

<h5>Attacking as an Opposed Attempt</h5>
<p>A basic melee attack is handled as an <a href="#opposed-attempts">Opposed Attempt</a> to strike a target. The steps in resolving the attack are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><span id="attacker-declares-attack">The attacker declares his attack</span> against the defender, after verifying the following conditions:
    <ul class="bulleted circle">
      <li>The defender is within the <a href="#melee-weapons">Reach</a> or <a href="#ranged-weapons">Range</a> of his attack</li>
      <li>The attacker has clear or partial <a href="#">Line of Sight</a> to the defender</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span id="defense-checks">The defender makes a <a href="#opposed-attempts">Defense Check</a></span> to avoid being hit
    <ol class="lower-alpha">
      <li>The defender rolls two exploding Finesse dice</li>
      <li>The defender adds his current Defense Adjustment<strong>&ast;</strong></li>
      <li>The resulting value is the CR for the attack</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><span id="attack-checks">The attacker makes an <a href="#opposed-attempts">Attack Check</a></span> to hit the defender
    <ol class="lower-alpha">
      <li>The attacker rolls two exploding Stat Dice appropriate for his weapon (<a href="#melee-weapons">Brawn or Finesse</a>)</li>
      <li>The attacker adds any Adjustments to the attack<strong>&ast;</strong> to the roll</li>
      <li>If the total equals or exceeds the CR set by the defender's roll, the Attack hits</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><span id="attack-hits">If the attack hits,</span> damage is resolved by rolling <a href="#effect-rolls">Effect dice</a>.
    <ol class="lower-alpha">
      <li>The attacker rolls the Effect die for <a href="#melee-weapons">his weapon's Check Stat</a>.</li>
      <li>The attacker adds any Damage Adjustments<strong>&ast;</strong> to set the raw damage inflicted.</li>
      <li>The defender subtracts any Armor Adjustments<strong>&ast;</strong> from the raw damage to determine actual damage sustained.</li>
      <li>The defender deducts the damage sustained from his current <a href="#stats">Hit Points</a>.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>&ast;</strong> Defense, Attack, Damage and Armor Adjustments are typically made for conditions such as special skills or maneuvers, active spells or magic items, etc.</em></p>

<h6>Melee Weapons</h6>
<div id="melee-weapons" class="ftrm-half">
  {% include tables/summary-melee-weapons-table.html %}
</div>

<ul class="ftrm">
  <li><strong>Check Stat:</strong> The Primary Stat Dice used in <a href="#attack-checks">Attack Checks</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="skills">Skill:</a> The Weapon Skill required to wield the weapon without penalty; Attackers lacking the appropriate weapon skill suffer a -2 penalty to their Attack Check</li>
  <li><a href="#attacker-declares-attack"><span id="reach">Reach:</span></a> The distance, in spaces, at which the weapon can be used to attack
    <ul class="bulleted">
      <li><em>Reach 0:</em> Attacker and Defender in same space (HtH combat)</li>
      <li><em>Reach 1:</em> Attacker and Defender in adjacent spaces</li>
      <li><em>Reach 2 or 3:</em> Defender in the second or third space away from the Attacker</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>1h and 2h Brawn Minimums:</strong> Minimum Brawn required to use the weapon in one hand (allowing another object to be held in the other hand or two hands (no other objects may be held in hands); for every point by which the Brawn Minimum exceeds the Attacker's Brawn, he suffers a penalty of -1 to all Attack Checks and Damage rolls.</li>
  <li><strong>Damage:</strong> Base damage inflicted by a normal weapon of the type wielded by a character meeting the Brawn Minimum; there is no bonus to damage for Attackers with a greater Brawn than their weapon's Brawn Minimum.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="unarmed-combat">Unarmed Combat Damage</h6>
<p>Unarmed attacks may be made at <a href="#reach">Reach 0 or 1</a>. Attacks with small improvised weapons, such as a beer mug or fist-sized rock used as a bludgeon, also have a Reach of 0 or 1. Longer improvised weapons (axe handle, chair leg) are essentially clubs, and should be treated as <a href="#skills">Mace Skill</a> weapons of similar proportion in all ways.</p>
<p>Unarmed attacks inflict damage equal to 1/2 times the <a href="#stats">Attacker's Brawn die</a>, rounded up. Small improvised weapons add 1 to the basic damage for an Unarmed Attack for every 5 points of the Attacker's Brawn.</p>

<h5 id="ranged-combat">Ranged Combat</h5>

<p>Like Melee Combat, Ranged Combat is resolved as an <a href="#opposed-attempts">Opposed Attempt</a>, with special Adjustments made to Attack Checks according to the <a href="#range">distance from the Attacker to the Defender</a>.</p>

<div id="ranged-weapons" class="ftrm-half">
{% include tables/ranged-weapons-table.html %}
</div>

<ul class="ftrm">
  <li><strong>Check Stat:</strong> All Ranged Weapons use Finesse dice in Attack Checks</li>
  <li><strong>Skill:</strong> The Weapon Skill required to wield the weapon without penalty (see Skills); Attackers lacking the appropriate weapon skill suffer a -2 penalty to their Attack Check</li>
  <li><strong><span id="range">Base Range:</span></strong> The distance, in spaces, within which the weapon is most effective
    <ul class="bulleted">
      <li>Within the base Range, Ranged Attack Checks take no penalty.</li>
      <li>Every doubling of the base Range imposes a penalty of -2 on the Attack Check.</li>
      <li>Ranged weapons may not be used to attack defenders in the same space as the attacker (0 Range).</li>
      <li>Ranged weapon attacks against defenders in spaces adjacent to the attacker (Range 1) take a -2 penalty to the Attack Check, unless the defender is motionless.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Range Limit:</strong> The maximum multiple of the Base Range at which the weapon may attack an individual target</li>
  <li><strong>Hands:</strong> The number of hands&mdash;one or two&mdash;necessary to ready, aim, and attack with the weapon</li>
  <li><strong>Brawn Minimums:</strong> Minimum Brawn required to use the weapon; for every point by which the Brawn Minimum exceeds the Attacker's Brawn, he suffers a penalty of -1 to all Attack Checks and Damage rolls. <em>Crossbows</em> have special rules regarding Brawn Minimums and Damage(see below).</li>
  <li><strong>Damage:</strong> Base damage inflicted by a normal weapon of the type wielded by a character meeting the Brawn Minimum; there is no bonus to damage for Attackers with a greater Brawn than their weapon's Brawn Minimum.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Shields</h5>
<p>Shields are used to block or deflect blows, applying a positive  <a href="#defense-checks">Adjustment to Defense</a>. Shields occupy the character's off hand, may not be used in conjunction with two-handed weapons, either Melee or Ranged.</p>

{% include tables/summary-shields-table.html %}

<ul class="ftrm">
  <li><strong>Type:</strong> Listed shield types are representative; other types are possible</li>
  <li><strong>Defense Adjustment:</strong> The value added to the character's Defense</li>
  <li><strong>Brawn Minimum:</strong> Minimum Brawn to use the shield without penalty; for each point the character's Brawn is below the Brawn Minimum, he suffers an Adjustment of -1 on all Brawn and Finesse Check rolls, including Attack Checks</li>
  <li><strong>Spellcasting Adjustment:</strong> Penalty to Savvy Check when casting any spell requiring gestures</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="armor">Armor</h5>
<p>Armor is worn on the body to reduce the damage sustained from incoming attacks. Non-magical armor has no effect on the attacker's chances to hit the defender&mdash;it only reduces damage.</p>

<div id="armor-table">
  {% include tables/summary-armor-table.html %}
</div>

<ul class="ftrm">
  <li><strong>Type:</strong> Listed armor types are representative; other types are possible</li>
  <li><strong>Category:</strong> All armor types fall into one of three categories:
    <ul class="bulleted">
      <li><em>Light:</em> Damage Adjustment 1 or 2; Brawn Minimum 5, 6 or 7</li>
      <li><em>Medium:</em> Damage Adjustment 3 or 4; Brawn Minimum 8, 9, or 10</li>

  <li><a href="#attack-hits">Damage Penalty:</a> The amount by which damage from incoming attacks is reduced by the defender's armor before it is deducted from his Hit Points.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Brawn Minimum:</strong> Minimum Brawn to wear the armor without penalty; for each point the character's Brawn is below the Brawn Minimum, he suffers the following penalties:

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h5>Damage and Injury</h5>
<p>Damage may be inflicted by physical or magical attacks, accidental injury, disease, or environmental stress. A character's ability to survive damage is quantified by Secondary Stat, Hit Points. Damage sustained reduces Hit Points from their maximum, healthy value. When a character's current Hit Point total is reduced to or below 0, he is incapacitated and probably dying.</p>

<h6 class="ftrm-none">Calculating Damage</h6>
<p>Damage from physical attacks is determined by rolling the Damage Die for the weapon used in the attack, as described in #4 of "Attacking as an Opposed Attempt," above. The attacker applies any Damage Adjustments to the value rolled to find the damage inflicted. Then the defender applies any Armor Adjustments to determine the amount of damage sustained, and deducts that amount from his current Hit Points.</p>
<p>Damage from other sources&mdash;such as magical effects, accidental injury, disease or distress&mdash;is calculated according to the rules for that damage source.</p>

<h6 class="ftrm-none">Status</h6>
<p>There are five statuses, based on current Hit Points:</p>
<ul class="bulleted ftrm">
  <li><strong>Healthy:</strong> Current HP = maxHP</li>
  <li><strong>Bruised:</strong> Current HP &gt;= half of maxHP </li>
  <li><strong>Wounded:</strong> Current HP &gt;= 1</li>
  <li><strong>Incapacitated:</strong> Current HP &lt;= 0; Character is unconscious, and may not move or act in any way</li>
  <li><strong>Dead:</strong> Current HP &lt;= 0 - maxHP; Character may not be healed by any means short of resurrection</li>
</ul>

<h6 class="ftrm-none">Stunning Blows</h6>
<p>Any time a character sustains damage in excess of one half of his maximum Hit Point value, he has suffered a <strong>Stunning Blow</strong>, and he may become <strong>stunned</strong>. He may avoid being stunned by immediately making a Brawn or Nerve Check against a CR equal to the amount of damage dealt by the injury.</p>
<p>A stunned character may not move or take any action on his own. He loses all Action Points and Free Steps, and has Disadvantage on all Defense rolls. He may be guided by another character to sit, fall prone, or walk at a rate of 1 space per Round.</p>
<p>Being stunned is a <strong>Persistent Condition</strong>. A stunned character makes a Recovery Check using Brawn or Nerve during the Reset Phase of each Turn. Once the character succeeds at a Recovery Check, the stunned condition is removed; the character resets his Action Points and Free Steps, may act normally in the Action Phase of the next Turn.</p>

<h6 class="ftrm-none">Dying from Injuries</h6>
<p>A character whose Hit Points have been reduced to or below 0 is <strong>dying</strong>. He will continue to lose 1 Hit Point <em>per Turn</em> (not per Round) until his current Hit Points reach the inverse of his maximum Hit Point value, at which point he becomes <strong>dead</strong>.</p>
<p>A dying person may be <strong>stabilized</strong> to stop the continuing loss of Hit Points. Any successful healing spell cast upon the dying character automatically stabilizes his condition, so he is no longer dying. Stabilizing a dying character with conventional First Aid requires a successful Savvy Check (see below).</p>

<h5>Healing</h5>
<p>Injured characters may recover lost Hit Points through various types of healing.</p>

<h6 class="ftrm-none">First Aid</h6>
<p>During combat, First Aid may be used to <strong>stabilize</strong> a bleeding or dying character, removing the adverse condition and stopping further loss of Hit Points. In combat, Administer First Aid is an Action requiring a full Round to perform, with an AP cost of 3/Only. First Aid applied in combat <em>only</em> stops Hit Point loss due to a bleeding or dying condition; it does not restore any of the lost HP. To Stabilize a bleeding or dying character, the character administering first aid must succeed on a Savvy Check; stabilizing a <em>bruised</em> character is an Easy Challenge (CR 6), while stabilizing a <em>wounded</em> or <em>incapacitated</em> character is a Moderate Challenge (CR 9).</p>
<p>Immediately after combat or other injury, First Aid may be administered to <strong>bind wounds</strong> suffered by an injured character, restoring a small number of Hit Points lost due to injury in the preceding incident. Binding the wounds of a bruised character is an Easy Challenge (CR 6), restoring 1 lost HP. Binding the wounds of a wounded or incapacitated character is a Moderate Challenge (CR 9), restoring 2 lost HP to a wounded patient, or restoring an incapacitated patient to 0 HP. Binding the wounds of an injured character takes several minutes of relative calm, requires first aid supplies including bandages, and must be done no more than 30 minutes after the injury was sustained.</p>

<h6 class="ftrm-none">Magical Healing</h6>
<p>Injured characters may also be healed through the application of healing magic in the form of spells, rituals, potions, or artifacts. The mechanics of magical healing vary, and are detailed in the rules for the specific spell or other means of healing.</p>

<h6 class="ftrm-none">Rest and Recuperation</h6>
<p>After the initial application of First Aid, and barring magical intervention, time and rest are the best source of healing. Once every 24 hours, an injured character makes a Healing Check, using Brawn or Nerve, in a Scaling Challenge, with each rank of success restoring one Hit Point. The Challenge Rating for the Check varies according to the hero's circumstances:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Healing Circumstances</th>
    <th>Challenge</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="table-sentence">Resting comfortably, warm, dry, and well fed</td>
    <td>Easy (6)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="table-sentence">Resting under field conditions, such as a tent in the wilderness</td>
    <td>Moderate (9)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="table-sentence">Resting under difficult conditions, such as hidden in a cave</td>
    <td>Hard (12)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="table-sentence">Prevented from resting at all, perhaps fleeing pursuit or being forced into physical labor</td>
    <td>Heroic (15)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>A competent caregiver can improve the rate of recovery. To do so, the caregiver makes a Savvy Check against a Scaling Challenge. The Challenge Rating for the check is based on the caregiver's level of training as a healer. Each rank of success in the caregiver's Check affords the patient an Adjustment of +1 on his Healing Check.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Caregiver's Competence</th>
    <th>Challenge</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="table-sentence"><em>Doctor</em>, or the cultural equivalent (Foreman Healer or better)</td>
    <td>Easy (6)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="table-sentence"><em>Nurse, field medic,</em> or <em>midwife</em> (Apprentice or Journeyman Healer)</td>
    <td>Moderate (9)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="table-sentence"><em>Sympathetic amateur</em> (No Healing skill)</td>
    <td>Hard (12)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
<p>Skills categorize and quantify a hero's training and experience. If a hero possesses a given Skill, he rolls his normal Stat Dice without adjustment when applying that skill to a challenge. If he lacks the relevant skill, he usually rolls his Stat Dice with a penalty of -2. A few skills are so rare or specialized that untrained characters are not allowed to attempt the task at all, depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>A few skills, including Alertness, Leap, and Lift/Shift, are <strong>Common Skills</strong>&mdash;every hero possesses each of these skills at the Apprentice Rank at no cost in Character Points.</p>

{% include tables/skills-table.html %}

<h5 class="hdrm-more">Skill Ranks</h5>
<p>Skills may be improved beyond their basic level. Each Skill Rank above the basic level affords the hero a bonus on his Check rolls using that skill. Total Cost is the cost in Character Points to buy that Skill Rank all at once, at the time of character creation; Upgrade Cost is the cost in CP to buy that Rank if the character has already purchased the preceding Rank.</p>

{% include tables/skill-ranks-table.html %}

<h5 class="hdrm-more">Skill Sets</h5>
<p>Most Skills are included in one or more Skill Sets. Purchasing a Skill Set at the listed price gains the hero every Skill in the Set at a discount over buying each skill separately.</p>
<p>Skills in a Set also improve together. For each Skill Set, the Skill Sets Table lists a Number for Rank value. When a hero improves that many Skills within the Set to a given Rank, the remaining Skills in the Set also improve to that Rank at no additional cost. For example, Melee Weapons Set has a Number for Rank of 3. As soon as a hero improves his third Melee Weapon Skill to Journeyman Rank, <em>all</em> his Melee Weapon Skills immediately improve to Journeyman Rank.</p>
<p>A few skills, such as Ride, are included in more than one Skill Set. In such cases, the overlap does not reduce the cost to purchase either Skill Set at the Apprentice rank. Additional ranks in such "overlap skills" <em>do</em>, however, count toward the <em>Number for Rank</em> to rank-up both Skill Sets.</p>
<p>The Character Point cost of a Skill Set including a Common Skill is not discounted in any way. Additional ranks in Common Skills <em>do</em>, however, count toward the <em>Number for Rank</em> to rank-up the entire Skill Set.</p>

{% include tables/skill-sets-table.html %}

<h5 class="hdrm-more">Skill Packages</h5>
<p>Every character created under the Core Rules for <em>Dungeons of Olde</em> chooses a Skill Package&mdash;a collection of related skills that suitable to his role within the party. The optional <strong>Crunchy Characters</strong> rules afford players the option to choose their skills a la carte using a point-based system, tailoring their hero to their unique vision. Nonetheless, a character built with a Core-Rules Stat Set and Skill Set is balanced with characters created under the Crunchy Characters system, so there is no danger in allowing some players to create customized characters while others choose Stats and Skills under the Core Rules.</p>
