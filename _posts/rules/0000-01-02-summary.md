<p>This page summarizes the key mechanics that form the foundation of the <em>Dungeons of Olde</em> rule system. It is presented as a concise set of notes, without explanation or example, for quick reference. Fuller explanations of the Core Rules mechanics are presented on the pages that follow.</p>

<h2>Stats</h2>

  <tr>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Brawn:</strong> Physical might</li>

<p>Starting characters may choose from the following Stat Sets. The values in each set may be assigned to the Primary Stats in any order. Secondary Stats are then derived from the assigned Primary Stat values.</p>

<h2>Dice</h2>
<h5>Dice declarations</h5>
<p>Die rolls are described in the following format: <strong><em>N</em>d<em>S</em></strong>, where <strong><em>N</em></strong> is the number of dice thrown, and <strong><em>S</em></strong> is the number of sides on the die. Exploding dice are indicated with an <strong>!</strong> at the end. Thus, a declaration of <strong>2d6</strong> means two six-sided dice, while <strong>2d8!</strong> indicates two <em>exploding</em> eight-sided dice.</p>

<h5>Die Ranks</h5>
<p>Dice have a <strong>Die Rank</strong> (DR) equal to their number of sides. Thus, d6's have DR 6.</p>

<h5>Stat Dice</h5>
<p>Each of a character's Primary Stats has an associated die, with a Die Rank equal to the value of that Stat. Thus, if a hero has Savvy 6, his Savvy die is a d6.</p>

<h6 class="ftrm-none">Modifying Stat Dice</h6>
<p>Some persistent conditions can <strong>Modify</strong> the Die Rank of a given Stat Die. Modifications do not affect the value of the Stat itself, but effect all die rolls based on that Stat as long as the condition persists. Stat Die Modifications are applied before the dice are rolled, to each die thrown. For example, a hero with Brawn 8 contracts an illness that applies a Die Rank modifier of negative two to Brawn; until that illness is cured, he will have to roll his Modified Brawn dice, d6's, instead of his normal Brawn dice, which are d8's.</p>

<h5>Exploding Dice</h5>
<p>Many rolls in <em>Dungeons of Olde</em> are made with <em>exploding dice</em>. When rolling an exploding die, if the maximum value for a die is rolled, its value is counted in the total for the roll, then the die is thrown again, and <em>that</em> value is also added to the total. The process is repeated until the die shows a result other than the maximum value.</p>
<p>For example, an exploding d8 is thrown and shows an 8, the maximum possible value. That 8 is counted as part of the total for the roll, and the die is thrown again, this time showing a 4. Since 4 is <em>not</em> the maximum value on a d8, the roll is now finished. The 4 on the second throw is added to the previous total of 8, for a final total of 12.</p>

<h5>Odd Dice</h5>
<p>When rolling a die with an odd-numbered Die Rank (5, 7, 9, etc.), roll the next larger die, and count the maximum result as if it were the median (middle) result. For example, for a d7, roll a d8, and count any roll of "8" as if it were the median value of 4.</p>
<p>An odd die explodes when the named value of the die is thrown. That is, a d5 explodes when a "5" is thrown. Thus, when d5! is thrown, results of "1," "2," "3," and "4" are counted at their face value; a "6" is counted as a 3; and a "5" explodes, contributing 5 to the total and rolling again.</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>Any task where there is a chance of meaningful failure is resolved as a <strong>Challenge</strong>. The difficulty of the Challenge is expressed as a number, called the <strong>Challenge Rating</strong>.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Difficulty</th>
    <th>Challenge Rating</th>
    <th></th>
    <th>Difficulty</th>
    <th>Challenge Rating</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Trivial</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Heroic</td>
    <td>15</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Easy</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Superhuman</td>
    <td>18</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Hard</td>
    <td>12</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>Godly</td>
    <td>21</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>When a hero tries to overcome a Challenge, he makes an <strong>Attempt</strong>. An Attempt always includes a <strong>Check Roll</strong>, which determines <em>if</em> he succeeds at the task, and may include an <strong>Effect Roll</strong>, which determines the <em>degree</em> of that success.</p>
<p>Every Attempt is made using Stat Dice for the Primary Stat relevant to the nature of the Challenge. For example, a Challenge calling for brute force uses a hero's Brawn dice, while a Challenge requiring courage uses his Nerve dice.</p>

<h5>Check Rolls</h5>
<p>Success in an Attempt requires a Check Roll, in which the hero must roll equal to or above the Challenge Rating on two exploding Stat Dice. A character with Brawn 8 Attempting to lift a heavy portcullis (Challenge Rating 12) would need to roll a 12 or better on 2d8!.</p>

<h6 class="ftrm-none">Adjusting Check Rolls</h6>
<p>Certain skills, items or other circumstances may adjust the result of a Check Roll. Adjustments may add to or subtract from the result of the Check roll, and are applied once only, after all exploding dice have been resolved.</p>

<h6 class="ftrm-none">Opposed Attempts</h6>
<p>A Challenge that pits one character directly against another requires an <strong>Opposed Attempt</strong>. The character making the Opposed Attempt is called the <strong>Instigator</strong>, while the character resisting the Attempt is the <strong>Target</strong>.</p>
<p>In an Opposed Attempt, each character rolls two exploding Stat Dice. The target rolls first, and his result becomes the CR for the Instigator's Check Roll. Then the instigator rolls. If the instigator's roll equals or exceeds the target's roll, the Opposed Attempt succeeds.</p>

<h6 class="ftrm-none">Assisted Attempts</h6>
<p>Certain Challenges may allow for an ally to <strong>Assist</strong> a hero attempting a Challenge (Instigator). The Assistant makes a Check Roll with a Challenge Rating equal to the Relevant Stat of the Instigator. If the Assistant's Check Roll equals the Instigator's Relevant Stat, the Instigator gets +1 on his Attempt. This bonus is increased by +1 for every <em>two</em> points by which the Assistant's Check Roll exceeds the Instigator's Relevant Stat.</p>

<h5>Effect Rolls</h5>
<p>In some cases, a successful Check Roll is followed by an Effect Roll, to determine <em>how effective</em> the success was. Effect Rolls also use the die for the Relevant Stat. Depending on the circumstances, an Effect Roll may call for one, two, or more dice. Effect rolls are made with exploding dice, unless the rules specify otherwise.</p>

<h2>Actions and Movement</h2>
<p>Outside of combat, time and distance are controlled and narrated by the GM, following common sense and guidelines in the GM's section of these rules.</p>
<p>In combat, the game is played with miniatures on a square or hex grid. The map scale is approximately 5 feet per square. Time is measured in turns, phases and rounds, which are brief but somewhat flexible units.</p>

<h5>Turns and Phases</h5>
<p>Each turn is made up of an Action Phase and a Reset Phase. All movement and other actions are made during the Action Phase, which is broken up into a variable number of rounds. The Reset Phase is an accounting step, in which temporary conditions are resolved and persistent conditions are updated.</p>

<h6 class="ftrm-none">Reset Phase</h6>
<p>Combat always begins and ends with a Reset Phase. During the Reset Phase, the following steps are taken, in order:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Remove any <em>Temporary</em> conditions and adjustments</li>
  <li>Apply any <em>per Turn</em> effects</li>
  <li>Roll to end any <em>Persistent</em> conditions</li>
  <li>Recover 1 Mana Point <em>or</em> 1 Faith Point, player's choice</li>
  <li>
    Set Action Points (AP) and Free Steps for the coming Action Phase
    <ul class="bulleted circle ftrm">
      <li>Left-over Action Points and/or Free Steps from the preceeding Action Phase are lost</li>
      <li>Roll one Finesse Die for Action Points, and apply any adjustments</li>
      <li>Surprised characters receive <em>exactly</em> 1 Action Point in the first Reset Phase of a combat; afterwards, they roll for AP normally</li>
      <li>All characters receive a single Free Step each turn</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h6 class="ftrm-none">Action Phase</h6>
<p>The Action Phase is divided into a series of Rounds, in which each character has one opportunity to act by expending Action Points, according to the following rules:
<ul class="bulleted ftrm">
  <li>In each Round, characters act in descending order of <em>current</em> Action Points</li>
  <li>Once per turn, take Free Steps <em>before</em> performing any Movement or Action
    <ul class="bulleted circle">
      <li>The Free Step distance for medium-sized characters (humans, elves, orcs) is up to two spaces, which must be taken at once</li>
      <li>The Free Step for small-sized characters (halflings, dwarves, goblins) is one space</li>
      <li>Free Steps do not cost Action Points to use</li>
      <li>A character doesn't have to <em>spend</em> Action POints in the Round he uses his Free Steps, but a character must <em>have</em> AP remaining in order to use his Free Steps</li>
      <li>A character may take his Free Steps immediately before an <em>Only</em> action</li>
      <li>Free Steps remaining at the end of the Turn are lost</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In a single Round, a character may spend a total of no more than 3 Action Points to perform one Movement and/or one Action (see tables)
    <ul class="bulleted circle">
      <li>Action Points are marked off the character sheet as they are spent</li>
      <li>If a character has only 1 or 2 Action Points to spend in a Turn, he may spend <em>all</em> of his AP for the Turn to take an <em>Only</em> action</li>
      <li>When a character has expended all his Action Points, he may take no more actions until the next Turn</li>
      <li>Certain Actions may apply Temporary Adjustments to a character's attributes, especially Defense (see tables)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A character may pass his opportunity to act in the current Round, saving his Action Points until a subsequent Round</li>
  <li>The Turn ends when every character in the combat has either
    <ul class="bulleted circle">
      <li>Expended all his Action Points, and has 0 AP remaining, or</li>
      <li>Has passed on his opportunity to act in the current Round</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>After the conclusion of the Action Phase, play proceeds to the Reset Phase for the current Turn</li>
</ul>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>These rules first lay down the basics of melee combat, then present additional rules for brawling (close combat, generally without weapons) and ranged attacks.</p>

<h5>Attacking as an Opposed Attempt</h5>
<p>A basic melee attack is handled as an Opposed Attempt to strike a target. The steps in resolving the attack are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The attacker declares his attack against the defender, after verifying the following conditions:
    <ul class="bulleted circle">
      <li>The defender is withing the Reach or Range of his attack</li>
      <li>The attacker's line of sight to the defender is clear or partially obstructed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The defender makes a Defense Check to avoid being hit
    <ol class="lower-alpha">
      <li>The defender rolls two exploding Finesse dice</li>
      <li>The defender adds his current Defense Adjustment<strong>&ast;</strong></li>
      <li>The resulting value is the CR for the attack</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The attacker makes an Attack Check to hit the defender
    <ol class="lower-alpha">
      <li>The attacker rolls two exploding Stat dice appropriate for his weapon (Brawn or Finesse; see table)</li>
      <li>The attacker adds any Adjustments to the attack<strong>&ast;</strong> to the roll</li>
      <li>If the total equals or exceeds the CR set by the defender's roll, the Attack hits</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>If the attack hits, damage is determined by rolling Effect dice
    <ol class="lower-alpha">
      <li>The attacker rolls the Effect die for his attack, usually set by the weapon type (see table)</li>
      <li>The attacker adds any Damage Adjustments<strong>&ast;</strong> to set the raw damage inflicted</li>
      <li>The defender subtracts any Armor Adjustments<strong>&ast;</strong> from the raw damage to determine actual damage sustained</li>
      <li>The defender deducts the damage sustained from his current Hit Points</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>&ast;</strong> Defense, Attack, Damage and Armor Adjustments are typically made for conditions such as special skills or maneuvers, active spells or magic items, etc.</em></p>
