This first section of the _Dungeons of Olde_ rules lays out the core mechanics of the game in as few pages as possible. If you want to play a simple dungeon delve that lasts just an evening or two, these Core Rules should be all you need. If you decide to enrich your _Dungeons of Olde_ experience by running a richer, longer, more complex campaign, you may add any or all of the optional rule sets in the sections that follow the Core Rules.
