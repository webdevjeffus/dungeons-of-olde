<p>This first section of the <em>Dungeons of Olde</em> rules lays out the core mechanics of the game in as few pages as possible. If you want to play a simple dungeon delve that lasts just an evening or two, these Core Rules should be all you need. If you decide to enrich your <em>Dungeons of Olde</em> experience by running a richer, longer, more complex campaign, you may add any or all of the optional rule sets in the sections that follow the Core Rules.</p>
