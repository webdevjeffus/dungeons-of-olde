<p>This first section of the <em>Dungeons of Olde</em> rules lays out the core mechanics of the game in as few pages as possible. If you want to play a simple dungeon delve that lasts just an evening or two, these Core Rules should be all you need. If you decide to enrich your <em>Dungeons of Olde</em> experience by running a richer, longer, more complex campaign, you may add any or all of the optional rule sets in the sections that follow the Core Rules.</p>

  <h2>Print Out Dungeons <span class="no-break">of Olde</span></h2>
  <p>Because <em>Dungeons of Olde</em> is changing so rapidly, any PDF of the rules would be obsolete in less than a week. In consideration of those who prefer read and play with printed rules, though, I have designed a special printer-friendly format for the website you can print from your browser. To print the rules, just right-click on the page, and select <strong>Print...</strong> When the printer dialog box opens, you'll see a preview of the pages as they will print, laid out in a two-column format, with all the unnecessary text, borders, and backgrounds removed.</p>
  <p>You are free to print any or all pages from the <em>Dungeons of Olde</em> website for personal use, and to share them with your friends. Please do not distribute them in any other way, though; if you want to spread the word, just share the link to the <a href="http://dungeonsofolde.com/">Dungeons of Olde</a> website.</p>
