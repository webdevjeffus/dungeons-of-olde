<p>Skills categorize and quantify a hero's training and experience. If a hero possesses a given Skill, he rolls his normal <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/core-rules/characters/#stats">Stat Dice</a> without adjustment when applying that skill to a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/core-rules/challenges/#challenges">challenge</a>. If he lacks the relevant skill, he usually rolls his Stat Dice with a penalty of -2. A few skills are so rare or specialized that untrained characters are not allowed to attempt the task at all, depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>A few skills, including Alertness, Leap, and Lift/Shift, are <strong><span id="common-skills">Common Skills</span></strong>&mdash;every hero possesses each of these skills at the Apprentice Rank at no cost in Character Points.</p>

<h5 class="hdrm-more">Skill Ranks</h5>
<p>Skills may be improved beyond their basic level. Each Skill Rank above the basic level affords the hero a bonus on his <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/core-rules/challenges/#check-rolls">Check rolls</a> using that skill. Total Cost is the cost in Character Points to buy that Skill Rank all at once, at the time of character creation; Upgrade Cost is the cost in CP to buy that Rank if the character has already purchased the preceding Rank.</p>

{% include tables/skill-ranks-table.html %}

<h5 class="hdrm-more">Skill Sets</h5>
<p>Most Skills are included in one or more Skill Sets. Purchasing a Skill Set at the listed price gains the hero every Skill in the Set at a discount over buying each skill separately.</p>
<p>Skills in a Set also improve together. For each Skill Set, the Skill Sets Table lists a <em>Number for Rank</em> value. When a hero improves that many Skills within the Set to a given Rank, the remaining Skills in the Set also improve to that Rank at no additional cost. For example, Melee Weapons Set has a <em>Number for Rank</em> of 3. As soon as a hero improves his third Melee Weapon Skill to Journeyman Rank, <em>all</em> his Melee Weapon Skills immediately improve to Journeyman Rank.</p>
<p>A few skills, such as Ride, are included in more than one Skill Set. In such cases, the overlap does not reduce the cost to purchase either Skill Set at the Apprentice rank. Additional ranks in such "overlap skills" <em>do</em>, however, count toward the <em>Number for Rank</em> to rank-up both Skill Sets.</p>
<p>The Character Point cost of a Skill Set including a <a href="#common-skills">Common Skill</a> is not discounted in any way. Additional ranks in Common Skills <em>do</em>, however, count toward the <em>Number for Rank</em> to rank-up the entire Skill Set.</p>

<h5 class="hdrm-more">Skill Packages</h5>
<p>Every character created under the Core Rules for <em>Dungeons of Olde</em> chooses a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/core-rules/characters/#skill-packages">Skill Package</a>&mdash;a collection of related skills that suitable to his role within the party. The optional <strong>Crunchy Characters</strong> rules afford players the option to choose their skills a la carte using a point-based system, tailoring their hero to their unique vision. Nonetheless, a character built with a Core-Rules Stat Set and Skill Set is balanced with characters created under the Crunchy Characters system, so there is no danger in allowing some players to create customized characters while others choose Stats and Skills under the Core Rules.</p>
