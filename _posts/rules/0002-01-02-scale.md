_Dungeons of Olde_ is played on dungeon tiles divided into a grid of squares roughly one inch on a side. Each square is generally imagined to about five feet on a side…unless six feet on a side makes more sense to you, or two meters. The miniatures representing the heroes and their opponents run between an inch and an inch-and-a-half high. Does that mean 1” = 6’, or does a figure need to be 1.5” tall in real life to represent a 6-foot tall hero in the game?

Similarly, the game is played in turns, each of which represents a vague but brief period of time. In combat, several turns may represent just a minute or two of actual time, but between fights, when things are less frantic, each turn may represent several minutes.

The point is, don’t strain your brain trying to work out the game scale—how many seconds are in a turn, or how many feet are in an inch on the map. It’s likely that no one will agree, and it’s certain that it doesn’t matter. What does matter is that we have some means of managing time and space within the game, so that each character has a fair chance to do what he intends. To handle these issues, the game has two modes: Exploration Mode and Crisis Mode. The Actions rules describe the flow of events during each of these game modes.
