<p id="characters">Player characters in <em>Dungeons of Olde</em> are often referred to as "heroes." Each hero has several Stats and Skills which determine his dungeon-delving abilities. Heroes created under the <em>Dungeons of Olde</em> Core Rules choose one <a href="#stat-arrays">Stat Array</a> and one <a href="#skill-packages">Skill Package</a>; heroes created under the <strong>Crunchy Characters</strong> rules option are built using a point-based system that allows players to customize their Stats and Skills. The Stat Arrays and Skill Packages in the Core Rules follow the Crunchy Characters point system, so there is no risk of imbalance if your party contains a mix of Core and Crunchy characters.</p>

<p>Starting heroes created under the <em>Dungeons of Olde</em> Core Rules choose from the following Stat Arrays. The values in each set may be assigned to the Primary Stats in any order. Secondary Stats are then derived from the assigned Primary Stat values.</p>

<h6 id="stat-dice">Stat Dice</h6>
<p>Each of a character's Primary Stats has an associated die, with a number of sides, or <a href="#die-rank">Die Rank</a>, equal to the value of that Stat. Thus, if a hero has Savvy 6, his Savvy die is a d6. Secondary Stats are only used to track a hero's state of health and energy, and therefore have no associated dice.</p>

<h5 id="skill-packages">Skills</h5>
<p>Each hero created under the <em>Dungeons of Olde</em> Core Rules chooses one Skill Package from the following table. More information on <a href="#skills">Skills</a>, including the contents of the various Skill Sets, is included in the Skills section of the Core Rules.</p>
