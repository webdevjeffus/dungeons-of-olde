As mentioned previously, a character rolls Check Dice to determine whether or not he manages to do something. Once he’s succeeded, he may need to roll his Effect Die to see how well he did it. Whether an Effect Roll is called for upon a successful Attempt, and how it is to be applied to the outcome, will be described on the rules for the particular skill or task being Attempted.

For example, Fustus the Friar intends to bestow a +1 Blessing upon his companions at the beginning of a battle. After he succeeds at a Nerve Check to perform the Blessing, the rules for Blessing instruct him to make a Nerve Effect Roll to determine how many of his allies actually receive the benefit. His Nerve is 8, so he rolls 1d8 for Effect; he throws a 5, so the Blessing affects Fustus himself, and up to 4 companions.

## Adjusting Effect rolls
Effect Rolls may be Adjusted, just like Check Rolls, if circumstances impact the effectiveness of the character’s Attempt. In the example above, Fustus' prayer of Blessing might be influenced by a relic in his possession, the Chain of Dolgur's Faith. The description of the Chain says it adds +1 to the user's Nerve Effect roll when he succeeds at casting any prayer. Thus, Fustus's Effect roll of 5 would be Adjusted by +1 for the Chain, so that 6 people would receive the benefit of Fustus's Blessing.
