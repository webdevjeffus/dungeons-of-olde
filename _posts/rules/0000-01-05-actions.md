<p>In <em>Dungeons of Olde</em>, time and distance outside of combat are controlled and narrated by the gamemaster, following common sense and guidelines in the gamemasters' section of these rules.</p>
<p>In combat, the game is played with miniatures on a square or hex grid. The <span id="scale"><strong>map scale</strong></span> is either 5 feet per space, or 2 meters per space, whichever your group prefers. Time is measured in <strong>Turns, Phases</strong> and <strong>Rounds</strong>, which are brief but somewhat flexible units.</p>

<h2 id="turns">Turns and Phases</h2>
<p>Each turn is made up of an <strong>action phase</strong> and a <strong>reset phase</strong>. All movement and other actions are made during the action phase, which is broken up into a variable number of <strong>rounds</strong>. The reset phase is an accounting step, in which temporary conditions are resolved and persistent conditions are updated.</p>

<h5 id="reset-phase">Reset Phase</h5>
<p>Combat always begins and ends with a reset phase. During the reset phase, the following steps are taken, in order:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Apply any <strong><span id="per-turn">per turn</span></strong> effects, such as poison or bleeding.</li>
  <li>Remove any <strong><span id="temporary">temporary</span></strong> conditions and adjustments (which end at the conclusion of the turn in which they were imposed).</li>
  <li>Roll to remove any <strong><span id="persistent">persistent</span></strong> conditions (which end only if the character succeeds on the necessary <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/core-rules/challenges/#check-rolls">Check roll</a>).</li>
  <li><strong><span id="recover">Recover</span></strong> 1 Mana Point <em>or</em> 1 Faith Point, player's choice.</li>
  <li>
    Set <a href="#action-points">action points</a> (AP) and <a href="#free-steps">free steps</a> for the coming action phase.
    <ul class="bulleted circle">
      <li>Left-over action points and/or free steps from the preceeding action phase are lost</li>
      <li>Roll one <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/core-rules/characters/#stat-dice">Finesse die</a> for <a href="#action-points">action points</a>, and apply any adjustments</li>
      <li>Surprised characters receive <em>exactly</em> 1 action point in the first reset phase of a combat; afterwards, they roll for AP normally</li>
      <li>All characters receive a single <a href="#free-steps">free steps move</a> each turn</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The current turn ends, and play proceeds to the action phase of the next turn.</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="action-phase">Action Phase</h5>
<p>The action phase is divided into a series of <strong><span id="rounds">rounds</span></strong>, in which each character has one opportunity to act by expending <a href="#action-points">action points</a>, according to the following rules:
<ul class="bulleted ftrm">
  <li>In each round, characters act in descending order of <em>current</em> action points.</li>
  <li>Once per turn, a character may take <strong><span id="free-steps">free steps</span></strong>.
    <ul class="bulleted circle">
      <li>The free step distance for medium-sized characters (humans, elves, orcs) is one or two spaces, which must be taken at once.</li>
      <li>The free step for small-sized characters (halflings, dwarves, goblins) is one space.</li>
      <li>free steps do not cost action points to use.</li>
      <li>Free steps may be taken in the same round as a normal movement and/or action, but they must be taken <em>before</em> any other <a href="#movements-table">movement</a> or <a href="#actions-table">action</a> in that round.</li>
      <li>A character doesn't have to <em>spend</em> action points in the round he uses his free steps, but a character must <em>have</em> AP remaining in order to use his free steps.</li>
      <li>A character may take his free steps before an <a href="#only-action">Only action</a>, either in an earlier round, or <em>before</em> the Only action in the same round.</li>
      <li>Free steps remaining at the end of the turn are lost.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In a single <a href="#rounds">round</a>, a character may spend a total of no more than 3 <strong><span id="action-points">action points</span></strong> to perform one <a href="#movements-table">movement</a> and/or one <a href="#actions-table">action</a>. Remaining AP are carried over into the next round of the current action phase.
    <ul class="bulleted circle">
      <li>action points are marked off the character sheet as they are spent.</li>
      <li>If a character has only 1 or 2 action points to spend in a turn, he may spend <em>all</em> of his AP for the turn to take an <strong><span id="only-action">Only</span></strong> action. A character may not perform any other movement or action, other than free steps, in a turn in which he takes an Only action.</li>
      <li>When a character has expended all of his action points for the current turn, he may take no more actions until the next <a href="turns">turn</a>.</li>
      <li>Certain <a href="#movements-table">movements</a> and <a href="#actions-table">actions</a> may apply <a href="#temporary">temporary adjustments</a> to a character's attributes, especially <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/core-rules/combat/#defense-checks">Defense</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A character may pass his opportunity to act in the current round, saving his action points until a subsequent round.</li>
  <li>The action phase ends when <em>every character</em> in the combat has either:
    <ul class="bulleted circle">
      <li>Expended all of his action points, and has 0 AP remaining, or</li>
      <li>Has passed on his opportunity to act in the current round.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>After the conclusion of the action phase, play proceeds to the <a href="#reset-phase">reset phase</a> for the current <a href="#turns">turn</a>.</li>
</ul>
