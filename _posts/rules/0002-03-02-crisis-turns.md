Once all characters are placed on the board, all character cards are prepped for play, and Action Points are set for all characters, the first turn of Crisis Mode begins.

Each turn in Crisis Mode consists of two Phases: the Action Phase, and the Reset Phase.

Each turn in Crisis Mode has two phases: an Action Phase, in which characters move, attack, defend, or take other actions; and a Reset Phase, in which players resolve end-of-turn game business, and get set up for the next turn.
