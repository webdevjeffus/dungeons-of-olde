Exploration Mode is how the game runs when things are calm or even cautious, and characters are exploring the dungeon environment. In Exploration Mode, figure that each turn lasts about a minute, and gives a character enough time to cross one dungeon tile (usually 4 squares) slowly enough to look carefully around each square as he passes, or to perform one specific task, like picking a lock or climbing up or down a ladder.

Generally speaking, when the game is in Exploration Mode, only the Heroes are taking action. Opponents and other NPCs are either inactive or not on the table. They move as a group through the dungeon, from one tile to the next, waiting whenever one character has a special task to perform, such as a wizard reading ancient runes carved in the wall, a priest praying for divine guidance, or a pathfinder sensing for true North. Or they may split up, moving separately and in rotation. This reveals the dungeon more quickly, but carries some risk, as the heroes run the risk of being caught alone in an ambush or other catastrophe.

Turn order is not critical in Exploration Mode, so long as all players are satisfied that they are getting the opportunity to do what they want or need to do. It is perfectly acceptable for one player to declare his intent for two or three turns in a row, so long as anyone else can interrupt at any point to say, “While you’re doing that, I do this…”
The Exploration Mode Table lists common actions Heroes take while the game is in Exploration Mode, and how long they take.

## Ending Exploration Mode
Whenever anything dangerous happens, such as an encounter with an enemy force or the triggering of a trap, the game shifts from Exploration Mode into Crisis Mode. In Crisis Mode, time and space are measured much more precisely, according to the Crisis Mode rules that follow.
